base caller called before graphsample

how restart after changing config.yaml
had to edit this file?

over and above depth-pick vcf_diff.py & vcf files  are the same


Flu compiled: @ 1000 and 500, the vcf_diff results appear to be the same

In the case of flu, I am skimming the depths off of the separate reads and
then recompiling them -- but there will be a new depth after the recompile
(i.e., I am skimming a different depth than the actual depth?)

I am getting some hits in the vcf for a depth 500 that are under in my minimized but which are not under 500 in the normal output.
