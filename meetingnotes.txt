USAMRIID test of version 4.1 â€“ last changes that need to be made prior to release to Andy for Pathosphere?
Version 4.2: Diamond integration updates
Version 4.2: SNAP integration updates
Version 4.2: Orf_Filter clarifications (version 4.3?)
Pipeline wishlist

compared output files
limit # singletons to look at (bc can take a long time)
SNAP is an option in the param file
Pathosphere is built from the param file
orf_filter should be used by Diamond? 
what's the point of blasting contigs that don't have open reading frames? 
* sift through blast results, filtering out 
* three iterative blast steps? 
* USAMRIID stopped including the BLASTX b/c it's too slow
* 1 is contigs, 2 is 
* currently 
* put unblasted FASTA file through orf then through BLASTX
* if diamond is as fast as it says it is, maybe could try it on reads
* but never use BLASTX as part of pipeline, always manually after 
* but probably will take BLASTX out of pathosphere
ORF filter in 4.2


expr $(wc -l ecoli.small.fastq | awk '{print $1}') / 4
16384 READS is
-> 3.6M

5461 reads = 1MB
DIAMOND creator has a nucleotide equivalent (algorithm)--wish-wish-list
metascope
wait for pathosphere to 4.2
4.2
April 30
4.3 may be final version
* Status indicator bar
* 
Pathosphere in May
know how many reads go to each contig
-> mapped back to contigs
-> construct from overlapping kmers
* what was he saying was the reason a read wouldn't map to a contig?
